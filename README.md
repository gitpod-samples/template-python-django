# Python Django Starter

A starter project for building a web site with [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/) in Python.

## Getting started

1. Create a fresh project in your account based on this [template](https://github.com/gitpod-io/python-django-example/generate).

1. Install Gitpod's [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/gitpod-io/installations/new) on your account.<br/>
The app will install a webook on your project to get informed when branches are pushed or updated. Gitpod will then prebuild your dev environments ahead of time, so noone has to wait for dependency installation and initialization anymore.

1. Run your first prebuild by prefixing https://gitpod.io#prebuild/ to the URL of the repository.<br/>
The revised URL is: `https://gitpod.io/#prebuild/https://github.com/<orgname>/<projectname>/`.<br/>
Gitpod displays the prebuild logs by running the init commands in the `.gitpod.yml` file and starts a first workspace based on the results afterwards. Later, when you create a new workspace on a branch, or pull/merge request, for which a prebuild exists, the workspace loads much faster, because all dependencies are already downloaded and the code is compiled. For more information, see prebuilds.

1. Share with your team 🚀
